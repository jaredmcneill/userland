RaspiCam Documentation
======================

This document describes the use of the three Raspiberry Pi camera aplications as of March 2013.

There are three applications provided, RaspiStill, RapiVid and RaspiStillYUV. RaspiStill and RaspiStillYUV are very
similar and are intended for capturing images, RaspiVid is for capturing video.

All the are command line applications, written to take advantage of the mmal API which runs over OpenMX. The mmal API 
provides an easier to use system than that presented by OpenMAX.

The applications use up to three OpenMAX(mmal) components - camera, preview and encoder. All applications use the 
camera component, RaspiStill uses the Image Encode component, RaspiVid uses the Video Encode component and RaspiStillYUV
does not use a encoder, and sends its YUV output direct from camera component to file.

The preview display is optional, but can be use full screen or directed to specific rectangular area on the display.
In addtion its is possible to not specifiy a filename, in which case the preview is display but no file is written.
